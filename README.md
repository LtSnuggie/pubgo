## documentation
Documentation can be found at [here](https://godoc.org/github.com/LtSnuggie/pubgo#PlayerResponse.GetPlayerData).

## testing
In order to run the tests locally you will need to add a conf.json file in the root folder

In the file you will need to add the following:
> {
>   "key"       : "[API key]",
>   "rateLimit" : [# of requests per minute]
>}
